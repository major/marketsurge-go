// Updating the report screen catalog from a HAR file
//
// The report screen definitions below are extracted from the MarketSurge
// web application's webpack bundle. MarketSurge does not expose a public
// API for listing built-in report screen descriptions, so this catalog is a
// captured snapshot of the UI metadata.
//
// Step 1: Capture a HAR file
//
//   Open Chrome/Firefox DevTools, go to the Network tab, and navigate to
//   marketsurge.investors.com. Open the Reports menu so the report screen
//   metadata bundle loads. Export the network log as a HAR file ("Save All
//   as HAR").
//
// Step 2: Find the webpack bundle entry
//
//   Search the HAR file for a known report screen name, such as
//   "Minervini Trend - 5 Months". The metadata currently lives in a
//   JavaScript chunk whose response body contains REPORTS_SCREEN entries.
//
// Step 3: Locate the report screen definitions
//
//   In the response body, search for a pattern like:
//
//     id:"120",type:"item",label:"Minervini Trend - 5 Months"
//
//   Each object has id, label, description, nodeId, and nodeType fields.
//   The id and nodeId values should match. Preserve descriptions verbatim,
//   including upstream spelling, punctuation, and embedded HTML snippets.
//
// Step 4: Update this file
//
//   Compare the extracted REPORTS_SCREEN objects against the catalog below.
//   Add new report screens, update changed descriptions, and remove entries
//   that no longer appear in the bundle.

// ReportScreenInfo describes a built-in MarketSurge report screen.
// Use the ID field as the numeric screen ID when running predefined report
// screens through [MarketDataAdhocScreenRequest].
type ReportScreenInfo struct {
	// ID is the numeric MarketSurge list ID for the report screen.
	ID int

	// Name is the human-readable label shown in the MarketSurge UI.
	Name string

	// Description explains the report screen criteria or purpose.
	Description string
}

// ReportScreens returns a copy of the built-in report screen catalog.
//
// The catalog is a captured snapshot of MarketSurge UI metadata. Callers can
// filter or search the returned slice by ID, name, or description.
func ReportScreens() []ReportScreenInfo {
	result := make([]ReportScreenInfo, len(reportScreens))
	copy(result, reportScreens)
	return result
}

Rankings are based on a combination of each company's profit growth; IBD's Composite Rating, which includes key measures such as return on equity, sales growth and profit margins; and relative price strength in the past 12 months. Some of the companies also appear on the IBD 100, which features a blend of small- mid- and large-cap names.    For investors who prefer less volatile investments with greater liquidity, the Big Cap 20 offers more mature yet still vibrant enterprises. Companies must have a minimum market value of $15 billion and trade more than 300,000 shares a day.",
